# FPGA Dinosaur Game  

## Introduction  
This project recreates the Google Chrome Dinosaur Game on an FPGA board. It is a side-scrolling game where the player controls a dinosaur to avoid obstacles and achieve the highest possible score.  

The implementation leverages:  
- **MicroBlaze Processor**: Handles game logic, including character movement, obstacle spawning, and input processing.  
- **Block RAM**: Stores graphical assets, including the game map and visuals.  
- **HDMI Output**: Displays the game on a screen using an RGB color mapper for rendering.  
- **USB Keyboard Input**: Allows user control of the game, integrating logic adapted from prior development work.  

## Key Features  
- Real-time gameplay with dynamic obstacle generation and scoring.  
- Smooth visual rendering and seamless integration of user input.  
- Demonstration of hardware-software co-design for digital game implementation.  

## Demo  
The project culminates in a live demo showcasing gameplay and the complete functionality of the game system.
